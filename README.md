# **LibraryDS18B20 for Net Core 2.0** #

This library allows you to read the temperature from the sensor DS18B20 connected to the Raspbery PI using Net Core 2.0.

In order to use the Library you must have installed the Net Core 2.0 runtime on your Raspberry Pi.

This Net Core Library requires the Shared Library libds18b20.so on the same location of the assembly LibraryDS18B20.dll

If you want to use this library for commercial projects please contact me to mendiola_loyola@yahoo.com

I'm including an example solution for Visual studio 2017, it uses the library LibraryDS18B20.dll

Regards.
Alfredo Mendiola Loyola
